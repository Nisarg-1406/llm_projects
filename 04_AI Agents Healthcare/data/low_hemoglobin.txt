Symptoms:
Low hemoglobin, commonly associated with anemia, occurs when the body lacks sufficient red blood cells to transport oxygen effectively. This condition can lead to fatigue, weakness, dizziness, shortness of breath, pale skin, headaches, and cold hands and feet. In severe cases, individuals may experience an irregular heartbeat, chest pain, or brittle nails. Causes of low hemoglobin include iron deficiency, vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency, chronic diseases, blood loss (due to menstruation or internal bleeding), or bone marrow disorders. Pregnant women, individuals with poor diets, and those with conditions like kidney disease or gastrointestinal issues are at higher risk of developing anemia.

Cure:
Treatment for low hemoglobin primarily involves dietary changes, supplementation, and addressing underlying causes. Consuming iron-rich foods such as spinach, lentils, beetroot, pomegranates, and jaggery can help boost hemoglobin levels. Additionally, foods rich in vitamin C (like oranges, amla, and bell peppers) aid iron absorption. For individuals with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency, dairy products, eggs, and fortified cereals are beneficial. In severe cases, iron supplements, B12 injections, or medical interventions may be required. It is also essential to avoid excessive tea and coffee, as they hinder iron absorption. Regular health checkups and a well-balanced diet can help manage and prevent low hemoglobin effectively.
